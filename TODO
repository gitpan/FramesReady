This is a list of things that we plan to implement in FramesReady.

  o  Future provision for levels and graphic images inclusion.

  o  Provide initial credentials so that we don't always have to get a
     401 response first.  Both for Basic and Digest authentication.
     This is in fact implemented for LWPng.

  o  Support PICS??

  o  Include more useful programs

  o  More documentation

  o  More tests

  o  Fix bugs, if there are any...
