	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Corrected for use of mirror that needed the parent class of
	FramesReady.pm to process so check was added to request().

	* t/net/mirror.t:
	Complete remake to get the RC_NOT_MODIFIED response and implement
	tests with Test::More for maintainability.

2010-04-07  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alansys.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* t/net/cgi-bin/moved:
	Altered to be perl script for possible mod_perl equiped Apache
	installation.

	* t/net/moved.t:
	Rewrote to use Test::More for better maintainability and
	modularization.

	* t/live/cpan.t:
	Removed cpan.t as it served no purpose in test either the FramesReady.pm or
	the Tree.pm module.

	* MANIFEST:
	Drop long commented out entries and live/cpan.t as it serves no
	purpose in testing either the LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm or the
	HTTP/Response/Tree.pm module.

2010-04-06  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alansys.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* t/local/http.t:
	Modified to to cleanup and not leave the temporary file behind.

	* t/local/frames.t:
	Rewrote to use Test::More for more flexibility and enhancement
	capability.  Added cat_all_content for frame concatenation for the
	prime use of scraping frames type harvests.

	* t/net/http-timeout.t:
	Rewrote to use Test::More expediting additions and changes.

	* t/net/http-post.t: Rewrote to use Test::More and enhanced testing.

	* t/net/http-get.t: Rewrote to use Test::More module and enhance tests.

2010-04-05  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alansys.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* t/local/frames.t:
	Re-implement testing using the Test::More moodule for better coverage
	of modules being tested.

	* t/local/autoload.t:
	Re-implement testing with the Test::More module to help increase
	coverage of modules being tested.

2010-04-02  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alansys.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* t/local/http.t:
	Extend timeout to allow by hand testing and allow close down to find
	active running daemon.

2010-03-31  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alansys.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* Makefile.PL:
	Hopefully requiring TAP::Formatter::File will eliminate the CPAN
	testers problem on Windows (ActivePerl) installations.

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Leave a few comments for anyone that looks for a reason that something
	didn't work but also the TEST script changed requiring a CVS assigned
	release number this module supplies.

	* t/TEST:
	Corrected change to eliminate warnings that disabled the 0 verbose
	parameter.

	* ChangeLog:
	Update for recent work to hopefully satisfy the build on Windows boxes
	running ActivePerl.

	* Makefile.PL:
	Added Test::Harness version that will satisfy the requirement for
	TAP::Formatter::File on a ActivePerl installation.

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Probably shouldn't have but the indent was bugging me and the
	transition to get() instead of request() was signified in the
	comments.

	* t/live/cpan.t:
	Slight burden to www.cpan.org but we probably can assume that it will
	only was respond where llarian.com and activestate.com may not.  Of
	course, the check needed to change with the URL being used.

	* t/TEST:
	Look for clean output by adding a check that there is input instead of
	assuming there will.

	* t/live/cpan.t:

	* t/TEST:
	Look for clean output by adding a check that there is input instead of
	assuming there will.

	* lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Added confirmation that this is part of the FramesReady packaging.

2009-01-05  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alansys.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* ChangeLog:
	Updated for historical reasons not knowing if this is still a
	requirement or anticipated element in the package.

	* META.yml:
	Editted by hand as it was unknown whether this file is any longer
	needed and ExtUtils::MakeMaker does not seem to any longer replace or
	update it.  The version was updated in any case.

2009-01-05  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alanhp.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* META.yml:
	Editted by hand as it was unknown whether this file is any longer
	needed and ExtUtils::MakeMaker does not seem to any longer replace or
	update it.  The version was updated in any case.

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	The LWP::Debug usage was removed as it was not effectively deployed in
	perl-libwww installations on all platforms.  The seemingly obsolete
	'use vars' was replaced by making globals ours.  Class hash elements
	were quoted to avoid clashes with internal names.  An
	$self->{'errstring'} was a crippled LWP::Debug replacement for
	testing.  Missing documentation for the nomax() getter and setter and
	new documentation for the errors.

	* t/net/cgi-bin/timeout, t/net/cgi-bin/test, t/net/cgi-bin/slowread, t/net/cgi-bin/nph-slowdata, t/net/cgi-bin/moved, t/net/cgi-bin/frametst, t/net/cgi-bin/frame1, t/net/proxy.t, t/net/moved.t, t/net/mirror.t, t/net/http-timeout.t, t/net/http-post.t, t/net/http-get.t, t/net/frames.s, t/net/config.pl.dist, t/local/protosub.t, t/local/http.t, t/local/frames.t, t/local/autoload.t, t/live/cpan.t, t/html/form.t, t/TEST, t/README, t/base/ua.t:
	Restore testing facilities into CVS repository.

	* MANIFEST:
	Modified to remove LWP::Debug since it is not always distributed with
	perl-libwww module in all platforms.

	* META.yml:
	Restore CVS repository to the version distributed with FramesReady 1.19

	* README:
	Removed the libnet and libwww requires along with LWP::Debug usage.

2009-01-04  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alanhp.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* README:
	Corrected email response address since n2h2 is defunct.  Added more
	requirements to cover those covered in the Makefile.PL file.

	* Makefile.PL:
	Rewrite of WriteMakefile structure to drop the requirement for
	LWP::Debug since some platforms do not include it with perl-libwww.

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Restore CVS repository to the current level deployed at version 1.19

2008-12-24  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alanhp.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* README:
	The prerequisites were slimmed down removing the LWP::Debug since CPAN
	testing does not implement it on a number of platforms.  The libwww
	should supply LWP::UserAgent or at least it used to.

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Evidently CPAN testing no longer uses LWP::Debug even though it
	appears perl-libwww still comes with that module so to enable a clean
	CPAN testing it is now commented out but available for uncomment if
	the need arises.

2008-12-23  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alanhp.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	It was missed that the very first character in the file was an
	unquoted 'c' prefixing the comment--an obvious fat finger situation.

2008-12-22  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alanhp.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Comments were enhanced and clarified when describing the callback.
	There should be a note that callbacks cannot be undefined as built
	into the process is the following out of redirects and refreshes.

	* Makefile.PL:
	Update with more required modules that are not part of the CORE
	distribution so CPAN testing should work.

2008-12-14  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alanhp.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* t/net/config.pl.dist:
	Restore config.pl.dist missing from the archive.

	* MANIFEST:
	Swapped activestate.t with cpan.t as the activestate.com site is
	obsolete.

	* t/net/frames.s: Restore frames.s missing from archive.

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Revised the documentation for the default performance to return an
	HTTP::Responce object in the event the return code is outside the
	range of 200-399 as suggested by Jason Novak.

2008-12-12  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alanhp.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* README:
	Modified the long wrong email address for bug reports and suggestions.

	* TODO: Added an addition entry for supporting user requests.

	* t/live/cpan.t:
	Replace ftp://activestate.com with ftp://cpan.llarian.com access.

	* README:
	Initial repository add at higher version for start repository recovery

	* Makefile.PL: Makefile.PL initiation of install

	* ChangeLog: Inserting ChangeLog while opening repository for checkin.

2004-03-06  Alan E Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2n2.com>

	* FramesReady.pm:
	Require a 2.001 version of LWP::UserAgent for setting of @redirects
	allowed.  Explicitly use the URI::URL module for abs().  Supply the
	missing @schema array missing since 1.10 version.  Drop the default
	UserAgent setting of Mozilla/5.0 for 302 redirects instead a list of
	URLs.  Enhanced pod documentation.  Added further Debug trace
	information.  Fix use of explicit use of internal callback in favor of
	that supplied by user or undef..  also the size.

2003-12-11  Alan E Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* Tree.pm: Initialize it to the 1.14 revision.

	* Tree.pm: Import of Tree v. 1.014

	* Tree.pm: New file.

2002-04-27  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added missing check for a $tree->code < 200.

2002-04-19  ewippre  <ewippre>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added variable declaration to avoid errors from some
	URLs during scan_page operation.

2002-04-16  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Optimize immediate return if content-type is not HTML.

2002-04-11  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Correct to not attempt reclassing and populating any
	response content if frames are not even possible w/code for errors
	greater or equal to 400.

2002-04-01  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Switch from TreeBuilder to TokeParser for ease of tag search
	and manipulation.  Corrected for the non-populate of a content-type
	header for FTP, GOPHER and other protocols the module may encounter.
	Correct to not try to track frames on an error page.  Added addendum
	to copyright notice for possible CPAN release.

2002-03-27  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Correct for problem with tracking frames when an error
	return exited early and didn't populate conditionally checked
	structure elements.

2002-03-22  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Correct for check of requested URI to first check for a 503
	(WAIT) error that causes the request method to not populate the field.

2002-03-21  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Better correction made that doesn't depend on assumed order
	of processing that an OR will return TRUTH on the first conditional
	check.  Arrays are checked as arrays and scalars as scalars.

2002-03-19  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Corrected for header Content-type being array or scalar
	values and not just as an array.

2002-03-15  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added check of each/every content-type header for test/html
	content for without it multiple content-types would not pass the test.

2002-03-11  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added check for early return of HTTP::Response to request if
	the URL was for a robots.txt file--short changes 404 and redirects.

2002-03-08  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Implement IFRAMEs and FRAMEs processing with fine tuning of
	the tree traversal.

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Initialized *uris variables sooner in the
	extract_frame_uris() so that an iframe in a body can set children to
	follow rather than only frames within framesets.  Optimized the code
	to release memory by the delete the $html structure with an error exit
	as well as a correct one.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Dropped leading white space trim for every iteration of the
	loop.

2002-03-07  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Made ready for production with a proper heading and fine
	tuning of class method.

2002-03-06  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Changed header (pragma) to 'no_wait' rather than
	'child_proc' to be more specific to its use.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	The cat_all_content() now concatenates both content and meta
	labels within the class.  The child responses are removed after the
	contenation.  Content is striped of leading and trailing white space
	to conserve on data space.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Strip leading and trailing white space from content and meta
	fields.  Remove children when through concatenating their content to
	the main response.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Corrected typo (missing line terminator).

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Added x-meta-keywords to the concatenation but directly into
	the $self->headers->{'x-meta-keywords'} rather than passing it back.

2002-03-05  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Embellished frameset search in body so if no more content is
	found an additional search does not bomb.  Added header
	'pragma' to disable wait state for requests in
	RobotUA::simple_request.

2002-03-03  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Modified request() to return earily if the content-type is
	not text/[s]html.

2002-03-02  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Temporary fix for disabling frames search on a text/plain
	results as expected by robots.txt file request.

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Modifications to request() function necessary to allow
	following redirects and other things that the extra parameters allowed
	the base class object to use.

2002-03-01  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Corrected calls and use of blessed HTTP::Response::Tree
	objects.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Ahh..  finally a working version but
	LWP::UserAgent::FramesReady needs better method of finding framesets.

2002-02-28  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Corrected possible blessed HTTP::Request::Tree child
	initialization but this should be handled within that module probably.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Recursion in member needs fixing while child
	($self->{_hrt_children}) appears to be fixed.

2002-02-27  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added head information for tracking release versions.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Added header information so version information is visible.

2002-02-26  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Checkin for Larry's latest version found on his machine.

2002-02-05  larry  <larry@noctis.ops.n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Stomped a subtle bug that prevented all frames from
	being returned in a frameset

2002-02-01  larry  <larry@noctis.ops.n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	LWP::UserAgent::FramesReady is a version of
	LWP::UserAgent that is capable of following frames

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	HTTP::Response::Tree - for holding collections of
	HTTP::Response objects
