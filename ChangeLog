	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	It was missed that the very first character in the file was an
	unquoted 'c' prefixing the comment--an obvious fat finger situation.

2008-12-22  Alan E Derhaag  <aederhaag@alanhp.newerasoftdevel.com>

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Comments were enhanced and clarified when describing the callback.
	There should be a note that callbacks cannot be undefined as built
	into the process is the following out of redirects and refreshes.

	* Makefile.PL:
	Update with more required modules that are not part of the CORE
	distribution so CPAN testing should work.

	* t/net/config.pl.dist:

	obsolete.

	* t/net/frames.s: Restore frames.s missing from archive.

	* lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Revised the documentation for the default performance to return an
	HTTP::Responce object in the event the return code is outside the
	range of 200-399 as suggested by Jason Novak.

2004-03-06  Alan E Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2n2.com>

	* FramesReady.pm:
	Require a 2.001 version of LWP::UserAgent for setting of @redirects
	allowed.  Explicitly use the URI::URL module for abs().  Supply the
	missing @schema array missing since 1.10 version.  Drop the default
	UserAgent setting of Mozilla/5.0 for 302 redirects instead a list of
	URLs.  Enhanced pod documentation.  Added further Debug trace
	information.  Fix use of explicit use of internal callback in favor of
	that supplied by user or undef..  also the size.

2003-12-11  Alan E Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* Tree.pm: Initialize it to the 1.14 revision.

	* Tree.pm: Import of Tree v. 1.014

	* Tree.pm: New file.

2002-04-27  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added missing check for a $tree->code < 200.

2002-04-19  ewippre  <ewippre>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added variable declaration to avoid errors from some
	URLs during scan_page operation.

2002-04-16  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Optimize immediate return if content-type is not HTML.

2002-04-11  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Correct to not attempt reclassing and populating any
	response content if frames are not even possible w/code for errors
	greater or equal to 400.

2002-04-01  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Switch from TreeBuilder to TokeParser for ease of tag search
	and manipulation.  Corrected for the non-populate of a content-type
	header for FTP, GOPHER and other protocols the module may encounter.
	Correct to not try to track frames on an error page.  Added addendum
	to copyright notice for possible CPAN release.

2002-03-27  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Correct for problem with tracking frames when an error
	return exited early and didn't populate conditionally checked
	structure elements.

2002-03-22  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Correct for check of requested URI to first check for a 503
	(WAIT) error that causes the request method to not populate the field.

2002-03-21  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Better correction made that doesn't depend on assumed order
	of processing that an OR will return TRUTH on the first conditional
	check.  Arrays are checked as arrays and scalars as scalars.

2002-03-19  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Corrected for header Content-type being array or scalar
	values and not just as an array.

2002-03-15  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added check of each/every content-type header for test/html
	content for without it multiple content-types would not pass the test.

2002-03-11  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added check for early return of HTTP::Response to request if
	the URL was for a robots.txt file--short changes 404 and redirects.

2002-03-08  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Implement IFRAMEs and FRAMEs processing with fine tuning of
	the tree traversal.

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Initialized *uris variables sooner in the
	extract_frame_uris() so that an iframe in a body can set children to
	follow rather than only frames within framesets.  Optimized the code
	to release memory by the delete the $html structure with an error exit
	as well as a correct one.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Dropped leading white space trim for every iteration of the
	loop.

2002-03-07  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Made ready for production with a proper heading and fine
	tuning of class method.

2002-03-06  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Changed header (pragma) to 'no_wait' rather than
	'child_proc' to be more specific to its use.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	The cat_all_content() now concatenates both content and meta
	labels within the class.  The child responses are removed after the
	contenation.  Content is striped of leading and trailing white space
	to conserve on data space.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Strip leading and trailing white space from content and meta
	fields.  Remove children when through concatenating their content to
	the main response.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Corrected typo (missing line terminator).

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Added x-meta-keywords to the concatenation but directly into
	the $self->headers->{'x-meta-keywords'} rather than passing it back.

2002-03-05  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Embellished frameset search in body so if no more content is
	found an additional search does not bomb.  Added header
	'pragma' to disable wait state for requests in
	RobotUA::simple_request.

2002-03-03  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Modified request() to return earily if the content-type is
	not text/[s]html.

2002-03-02  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Temporary fix for disabling frames search on a text/plain
	results as expected by robots.txt file request.

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Modifications to request() function necessary to allow
	following redirects and other things that the extra parameters allowed
	the base class object to use.

2002-03-01  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Corrected calls and use of blessed HTTP::Response::Tree
	objects.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Ahh..  finally a working version but
	LWP::UserAgent::FramesReady needs better method of finding framesets.

2002-02-28  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Corrected possible blessed HTTP::Request::Tree child
	initialization but this should be handled within that module probably.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Recursion in member needs fixing while child
	($self->{_hrt_children}) appears to be fixed.

2002-02-27  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Added head information for tracking release versions.

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Added header information so version information is visible.

2002-02-26  Alan E. Derhaag  <aderhaa@n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	Checkin for Larry's latest version found on his machine.

2002-02-05  larry  <larry@noctis.ops.n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	Stomped a subtle bug that prevented all frames from
	being returned in a frameset

2002-02-01  larry  <larry@noctis.ops.n2h2.com>

	* /cvsroot/lib/LWP/UserAgent/FramesReady.pm:
	LWP::UserAgent::FramesReady is a version of
	LWP::UserAgent that is capable of following frames

	* /cvsroot/lib/HTTP/Response/Tree.pm:
	HTTP::Response::Tree - for holding collections of
	HTTP::Response objects
